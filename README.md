# sampleWork

Each project will have it's own readMe file to discuss what I learned on each project and what I would improve on for each future iteration.

The artPortfolio was designed and developed solely by me. All other projects were a group effort. 

For the teamCharter, tinyLiving and countyQuiz I was in the lead developer role. 

On the teamHub project I was the lead designer.
