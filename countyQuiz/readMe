The last of three projects created with a team of three, down from the orginal four.

For these projects I took the role of lead developer.

This project was designed to recreate a website similiar to the Illinois Bike Safety Quiz. 

As a group we decided the Illinois quiz was dated and not much fun to work through.

Since we were developing a Children's version we wanted large buttons, fun colors and an easy to use UI with appropiate feedback.

It was important to keep the users score and also display why a particular answer was correct or not.

The quiz as a whole works but there are some additions needed. Including but not limited a button to retake the quiz if the score is too 
low and also a button to escape the screen when printing a certificate of completion.

There also needs to be some work done for the quiz to handle a mobile view.
