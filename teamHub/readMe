This project was created with a team 3 and a goal of being a safe space for team members to anonymously review each other. 

I was the lead designer for this project and my main goal was keeping the color palatte soothing and the UI interface simple and easy to
use. 

To get started open the login file and create two or more pseudo accounts to review each other.
