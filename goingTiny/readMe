The second of three projects created with a team of three, down from the orginal four.

For these projects I took the role of lead developer.

Our goal here was to develop an information website for a problem in the local community. 

Our team decided to discuss Tiny Homes with a look at both positive and negative effects.

For this project I continued to expand on how to use responsive frameworks and responsive design for images.

For a future iteration I would design a mobile version with media queries that would help certain images take over a 100% width
to seperate white space and text.

I would also probablly remove most if not all image and text banners to let the white space breath.
