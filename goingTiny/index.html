<p>Does the thought of living in you own affordable home excite you? Is the allure of a reduced mortgage and a simpler but more flexible lifestlye calling to you?</p>

<p>The Portland-Vancouver area, like much of the United States, is at a cross-roads in the search for attainable housing. While country or rural living remains a dream for many, the truth is that most people are forced to live near their jobs and can't afford a long commute. Finding housing in or near employment is increasingly difficult to find for people exisiting on a limited wage.</p>

<div class = "image"><img src="images/index1.png" alt="a single wooden tiny home">

</div>

<h2>There is no one solution for the urban housing dilemma</h2>

<p>The alternatives are few and costly to both the individual and to the community. The choices appear to be high density housing, such as small apartments inside high rise buildings, house sharing in exisiting older buildings, smaller homes on smaller lots or in "parks" where the home is often mobile and the space is leased, or in many cases <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/toolkit/article/562207">homelesness.</a></p>

<p>The larger the house and the land it rests upon the more expensive it will be. So it stands to reason that a smaller house on a smaller plot of land should cost less money. Many people are choosing the option of going tiny, building or purchasing a small affordable dwelling or tiny house and adjusting their lifestyle accordingly.</p>

<h2>Not all local laws allow for tiny homes</h2>

<p>While there has been explosive growth in the phenomenon of building tiny houses, less is known about what is needed to legally park a tiny house on a piece of property. You can build it - but where can you park it without being told that you are in violation and will have to suffer the <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/hg/index.ssf/2016/08/tiny_house_illegal_portland_cl.html">consequences?</a></p>

<p>Let's explore how a tiny house and going tiny might be legal in Vancouver's near future. Whether standing by itself, or as part of a tiny house community is right for you. This site will also explore ideas both for and against tiny house living. Lastly, you will find a resources at the bottom of each page for you to continue learning more about going tiny! </p>
