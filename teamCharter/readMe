The first of three projects created with a team of three, down from the orginal four.

For these projects I took the role of lead developer.

The challange for the charter was to convert pages and pages of words into an visually interesting web page.

On this project I began to experiment with responsive frameworks and hiding elements on click.

For a future iteration I would incoporate a mobile design with approipate media queries.

I would also incoporate more transitions to help with the UI.
