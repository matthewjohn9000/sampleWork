    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>Born and raised in Reading, Pa, north of Philadelphia, artist, student, photographer, traveler, Matt Lehr welcomes you to Surreal Dreamscapes. Some of his biggest influences include Salvador Dali, Hunter Thompson, and Don Quixote.</p>

    <p>One of Matt's favorite acitivies is golfing with his dad. An acitivity the two would do together weekly. It was during these weekly outings where Matt would have his first and most consistent eperiences being outdoors. Growing up in an urban envriorment Matt always appreciated any chance to escape the city and spend time with Mother Nature.</p>

    <p>When the oppurutnity came to do some traveling the answer was easy. Sure it would be tough to leave everything behind he's ever known but Matt knew so much more was calling. The chance to explore the country, with no real time table, was truely an amazing experience for the artist.</p>

    <p>Currently you can find Matt back in school working on a Web Development degree, with an interest in UX and HCI. Plotting his way through school, taking small road trips in the pacific northwest and planning his next big adventure.</p>
