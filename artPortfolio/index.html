    <p>Surreal Dreamscapes are a mix a photography, graphic design, and original artwork. Each piece is brought to life with it's own unique style and personality. Often working in a collage style experimenting and breaking things, all in the name of creating something new.</p>

    <p>The photography is inspired by a cross country trip that spanned roughly 7k miles traveling from Philadephia, south and to the westcoast, before finally resting in the pacific northwest. Each photo is then remixed to bring a brand new perspective to landscape photography.</p>

    <p>In addition to photography you will also be able to view and learn more about  graphic design pieces inspired by pop culture and original artwork on the <a href="gallery.html">gallery page.</a></p>
